	<p>FurScript ("the App") is operated by 클래리티 (Clarity), Business Registration Number 207-07-44613 ("we," "us," or

	<h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Core Functionality:</strong> Your pet data and health logs are used exclusively to provide the App's
			features — health tracking, SOAP report generation, AI observation extraction, and medication reminders.
		</li>
		<li><strong>On-Device AI:</strong> The App uses Apple's NaturalLanguage framework to extract clinical
			observations from your notes. This processing happens entirely on your device. No data is sent to any
			external AI service or server.</li>
		<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Sign in with Apple credentials are stored securely in your device's
			Keychain and used solely to authenticate your identity within the App.</li>
		<li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> If enabled, we use Apple's local notification system to send medication
			reminders. These are scheduled locally on your device — no server is involved.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
	<p><strong>We do not share, sell, rent, or transmit your personal data or pet health data to any third
			party.</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>No data is sent to external servers</li>
		<li>No analytics SDKs or tracking libraries are used</li>
		<li>No advertising networks receive your data</li>
		<li>Subscription transactions are handled entirely by Apple via StoreKit</li>
		<li>SOAP reports (PDFs) are generated locally and shared only when you explicitly choose to export them</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
	<p>All data is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. Authentication credentials are
		stored in the iOS Keychain, Apple's encrypted storage system. We do not operate any backend servers or cloud
		databases.</p>

	<h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Your data persists on your device as long as the App is installed</li>
		<li>You can delete individual pets, logs, or medications at any time by swiping to delete</li>
		<li>You can delete your account and all associated authentication data via <strong>Settings → Delete Account
				&amp; Data</strong></li>
		<li>Uninstalling the App removes all locally stored data permanently</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
	<p>FurScript is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If
		you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us at <a
			href="mailto:info@klarit.io">info@klarit.io</a>.</p>

	<h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
	<p>Under applicable privacy laws (including GDPR and Korea's PIPA 개인정보보호법), you have the right to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Access all data the App stores about you (it's all on your device)</li>
		<li>Delete your data at any time (via in-app deletion or uninstalling)</li>
		<li>Revoke consent for notifications (via iOS Settings)</li>
		<li>Request information about our data practices (contact us)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
	<p>The App integrates only with Apple's first-party frameworks:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>StoreKit 2</strong> — for subscription management (handled by Apple)</li>
		<li><strong>Sign in with Apple</strong> — for authentication</li>
		<li><strong>NaturalLanguage</strong> — for on-device text analysis</li>
		<li><strong>UserNotifications</strong> — for local medication reminders</li>
	</ul>
	<p>No third-party SDKs, analytics tools, or advertising frameworks are used.</p>

	<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
	<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top of this page indicates
		when the policy was last revised. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised
		policy.</p>
