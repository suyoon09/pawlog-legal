    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 22, 2026</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the FurScript mobile application ("App") operated by 클래리티 (Clarity), Business Registration Number 207-07-44613 ("we", "us", or "our").</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using FurScript, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>FurScript is a pet health logging application that helps pet owners track health observations, medications, and generate SOAP-format health reports. The App uses on-device AI (Apple NaturalLanguage framework) to extract clinical observations from user-provided notes. All data processing occurs locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>3. Medical Disclaimer</h2>
    <p><strong>FurScript is not a veterinary medical service.</strong> The App does not provide veterinary medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations. SOAP reports generated by this App are based solely on owner-provided data and are intended to supplement — not replace — professional veterinary examination. Always consult a licensed veterinarian before making medical decisions for your pet. In case of emergency, contact your nearest emergency veterinary clinic immediately.</p>

    <h2>4. Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>FurScript offers auto-renewable subscription plans:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> $5.99 USD per month</li>
        <li><strong>Annual:</strong> $35.99 USD per year</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A 7-day free trial may be offered to new subscribers. Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID Account Settings.</p>
    <p>Refunds are subject to Apple's standard refund policy. For refund requests, visit <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084">Apple Support</a>.</p>

    <h2>5. User Data</h2>
    <p>All pet health data, logs, and reports are stored locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store your pet health data on external servers. Please refer to our <a href="privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for detailed information about data handling.</p>

    <h2>6. Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>You may delete your account at any time through Settings → Delete Account & Data within the App. This will remove your authentication credentials from the device's secure Keychain storage.</p>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App and its content, features, and functionality are owned by 클래리티 and are protected by international copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, 클래리티 shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to damages arising from reliance on any information obtained through the App for veterinary decisions.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify users of material changes through the App. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

    <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
